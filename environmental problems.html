            The north of the city serves as a water reservoir for Bandung. However, the area has seen substantial residential development. Several attempts to protect this area have been made, including creating reserves such as the Juanda National Park and Punclut, but development continues. Regular flooding in Bandung's south also presents a real and dangerous ongoing problem.[38]

            From mid-2005, Bandung faced another environmental disaster when the city's landfill site was re-evaluated after a garbage slide in 2005 which buried a village, Kampung Gajah, beneath it, killing over a hundred people.[39] The accumulation of 8,000 m3/d (3,300 cu ft/ks) of domestic garbage causes severe air pollution by local burning, the spread of disease, and water contamination. The provincial government has failed in its attempts to solve the garbage issue.[40][41] Nevertheless, it was awarded in 1997 and 2015 as the least polluted city in the country.[42][43] Further, a regional award in 2017 was also given from ASEAN for the cleanest air among other major cities in ASEAN countries.[44]

            Bandung is also well known for its tornado hotspot. The first deadly tornado in the area occurred in Rancaekek during the Dutch Occupation in 1933 where a tornado struck the town, killing 1 and injuring none, the funnel destroyed 17 homes and left 30 homes badly damaged, many trees were either snapped or downed.[45] Another deadly tornado to occur on Bandung was on 18 December 2014, in Gedebage, the tornado struck the area in the afternoon. It left 85 houses either unroofed or destroyed, a large factory building suffered significant damage, a warehouse levelled and a library suffered roof loss, one person died due to crushed by a collapsed wall.[46][47][48]
